                                 Constraining the Values of your data.

1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
   cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
   excluded from the date field.

   create table orders
   (
    onum int (4) primary key,
    cnum int (4),
    snum int (4),
    odate date not null,
    foreign key(cnum) refrences customers(cnum),
    foreign key(snum) refrences salespeople(snum)
   );

2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
   NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
   between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).

    create table salespeople
   (
    snum int(4) primary key,
    comm float(7,2) default .10 not null,
    sname varchar(25) check(sname=upper(ename) and (sname>'A' and sname<'M'))
    ); 
    
3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
   the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.

   create table orders
   (
    onum int(4) primary key,
    cnum int(4) not null,
    snum int(4) not null
    );
