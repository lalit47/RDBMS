                                 Creating Tables and Indexes.
1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
   Orders table quickly.

->   create index i_odate_orders on orders(odate);
     show index from orders;
     select * from orders group by odate;

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
   be unique (assume all current values are unique)?
 
->   Onum field may be  modified to primary key to make it unique in orders table:-   
     Alter table orders modify primary key(onum); 
   
   
3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
   grouped by date quickly.

->     create index i_snum_odate on orders(odate,snum); 
       show indexes from orders;
       select snum,odate from orders group by odate;  

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
   rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

->   select snum,cnum,rating from customers
     group by rating;
