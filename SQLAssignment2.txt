                                Introducing Relational Databases.
                                ---------------------------------

  3) What is another word for row? For column?

Ans:-Another words for row and column are:-
                      Row->Tuple,Entity,Opportunity
                   Column->Attribute,Method

   4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?

Ans:- In RDBMS Rows of a table are not stored sequentially,
      they are scattered(fragmanted) all over the Database server HD 
      and when we insert a row into a table wherever the system finds
      the free space in the DB server HD it stores the row there.
      that's why it is not possible to see the first five rows of table.
