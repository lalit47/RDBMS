   who made the order.
 
->   SELECT O.ONUM,C.CNAME FROM ORDERS O,CUSTOMERS C 
     WHERE C.CNUM=O.CNUM;

2) Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for
   each order along with the order number.

->  SELECT S.SNAME,C.CNAME,O.ONUM 
    FROM SALESPEOPLE S,CUSTOMERS C,ORDERS O
    WHERE S.SNUM=C.SNUM AND S.SNUM=O.SNUM;

   commission above 12%. Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name,
   and the salesperson’s rate of commission.

      FROM CUSTOMERS C,SALESPEOPLE S
      WHERE S.SNUM=C.SNUM AND S.COMM>.12;
  

4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each
   order by a customer with a rating above 100.

->   SELECT C.CNAME,S.SNAME,O.AMT*S.COMM AS COMM
     FROM CUSTOMERS C,SALESPEOPLE S,ORDERS O
     WHERE C.RATING >100 AND O.SNUM=S.SNUM AND O.CNUM=C.CNUM;
