                                   -------------------------

1. Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
   customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”,
   while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

-> SELECT cname, city, rating, 'HIGH RATING'
   FROM customers
   WHERE rating >= 200
   UNION
   SELECT cname, city, rating, 'LOW RATING'
   FROM customers
   WHERE rating < 200;

2. Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each
   customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order

-> SELECT snum, sname, cname
   FROM salespeople
   JOIN customers using(snum)
   WHERE snum IN
  (SELECT snum FROM customers GROUP BY snum HAVING count(snum)>1)
   ORDER BY sname,cname;

3. Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San
   Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of
   all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate
   any redundancies between either of them and the first. (Note: in the sample tables as
   given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.

-> SELECT "salespeople" AS TYPE, snum
   FROM salespeople
   WHERE city="San Jose"
   UNION
   SELECT "customer" AS TYPE, cnum
   FROM customers
   WHERE city="San Jose"
   UNION ALL
   SELECT "order" AS TYPE, onum
   FROM orders
   WHERE odate="1990-10-03";
