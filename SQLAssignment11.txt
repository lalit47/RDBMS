                                          Subqueries
                                 -------------------------------


1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named
   Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).

->    select onum from orders 
      where snum=
      (select snum from customers where cname='Cisneros');

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
   above-average orders.

->   Select max(c.cname), max(c.rating), o.cnum
     from orders o, customers c
     where o.cnum = c.cnum
     group by o.cnum
     having count(o.cnum)>(SELECT  (count(cnum)-count(distinct(cnum)))/2 from orders);

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
   whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.

->    select sum(amt) as sum from orders
      where sum>
      (select max(amt) from orders);
